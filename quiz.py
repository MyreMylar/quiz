# For the next three weeks we are going to start a quiz program from scratch (no code to start), until it has the
# basics up and running then steadily add more features in future weeks until it is a *fancy* quiz program. You might
# call this process iterative development, and it's one way of developing software.
#
# Let's get started with the challenges below!
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Challenge 1
# ------------
# Create a text based multiple choice quiz.
#
# Your quiz program must:
# - Print out a question to the python console (use: print()).
# - Print out three potential answers to that question (labelled A:,B: and C:) on new lines,
#   only one of which is correct.
# - Wait for the user to input a letter; either A, B or C (use: answer = input()) and press enter.
# - Test the users input letter and print "Correct!" - if it is the correct answer (use an if(): statement)
# - If the answer is incorrect print "Wrong!" instead.
# - Repeat the process for three different questions
#
# To save you time, here are some example questions and answer strings to cut and paste:
# --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Questions:
# ------------
#
# "What is the capital city of France?"
# "A: Paris"
# "B: London"
# "C: Berlin"
#
# "Who is the prime minister of the UK?"
# "A: Donald Trump"
# "B: David Cameron"
# "C: Teresa May"
#
# "When was the battle of Hastings fought?"
# "A: 1066"
# "B: 1776"
# "C: 1966"
#
# Quiz master responses:
# -----------
# "Correct!"
# "Wrong!"
#
# Write your code below:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

if True:
    print("X")
    print("y")


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Challenge 2
# --------------------
#
# 1. Use a variable to keep track of how many questions the user gets correct.
# 2. print a 'final score' at the end of the quiz that looks something like this: "Final score: 2/3"
# 3. Correctly handle upper and lower case keyboard input by using the .lower() string function on it.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# ------------------------------
# Bonus Challenges
# --------------------
# To ponder, or have a go at - if you are a master of the codes.
#
#  - Consider how you might store the quiz data in a class and a python list.
#
#  - How would you ask the questions in a random order - without repeating questions?
#
#  - Could you use pygame to display the quiz questions in a fancier way?
